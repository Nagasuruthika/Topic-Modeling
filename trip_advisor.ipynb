            "We enjoyed the Best Western Pioneer Square. My husband and I had a room with a king bed and it was clean, quiet, and attractive. Our sons were in a room with twin beds. Their room was in the corner on the main street and they said it was a little noisier and the neon light shone in. But later hotels on the trip made them appreciate this one more. We loved the old wood center staircase. Breakfast was included and everyone was happy with waffles, toast, cereal, and an egg meal. Location was great. We could walk to shops and restaurants as well as transportation. Pike Market was a reasonable walk. We enjoyed the nearby Gold Rush Museum. Very, very happy with our stay. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable.\n",
            "Great visit to Seattle thanks to our stay at the Best Western Pioneer Square! The hotel was reasonably priced and close to everything we wanted to see - ferry ride, Underground Tour, Klondike Museum, short walk to Pike Market and other shopping. The staff was amazingly helpful and accommodating. Our room was very clean and had everything we needed. Breakfast was plentiful and very good. Before we booked, I read about some potential issues with the area. I can honestly say that the area was just fine! In fact, if you enjoy historic and quaint parts of town, this is definitely where you want to stay. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone who is headed to Seattle.\n",
            "Great Location,short walk from Amtrak station, Link or to a game. Price perfect for downtown Seattle. Historic Building, clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good. Staff friendly and helpful. The family is already thinking of the next stay. Super Cool Toy store across the street for all ages.\n",
            "Accommodation in Seattle can be expensive. This hotel is very reasonably priced, located just off Pioneer Square, close to shops and restaurants and public transport (light rail). It appears to have recently been completely renovated in a period theme. Rooms are small but well equipped comfortable and clean - reminds me a little of a European style hotel. Staff are polite and helpful - in a genuine way. It is suitable for all types of stays business to a romantic getaway. Next time your in Seattle stay here!\n",
            "Very cool old building in a great location. Check in went well (temp parking in front), parkade is about 1 block away. If you are there on a weekend, make sure you aren't getting screwed by the rates the hotel charges, compared to the parkade charges. Rooms are large. Non view rooms actually just look at a wall so might be bad if you are claustrophobic. DO NOT stay by the elevator. We were there mid afternoon and were given the room right behind the elevator when there were still lots of rooms left to book out. Even when the elevator didn't run, it banged constantly. We were able to move rooms the following day. It's an old building so the hallway floors creak. Also, we were there on a Sat. night and had young people partying around us. Sunday was much quieter. Breakfast was very good however the room was extremely small.\n"
